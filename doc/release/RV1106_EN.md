### New

1. Support full parameters in aiq for the first frame in fastboot.
2. Support set resolution and fps from meta partition.
3. Support sync meta header file.
4. Optimize the iq result for fast AE,The exposure decomposition is exactly consistent with aiq, supports DB gain synsensor, and supports the check exposure register
5. Enable AE statistics in full-parameter parallel solution.
6. Meta addresses can be configured using menuconfig

### Fixed

| Index | Severity  | Update                                                       | Issue description                                            | Issue source |
| ----- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| 1     | important | resolve "thread:tidle stack overflow" problem                | Sometimes "Thread: Tidle Stack Overflow" is displayed. RTT exits abnormally | none         |
| 2     | important | Suppore get  AE calibration parameters from iq bin           | AE calibration data is not vaild.                            | none         |
| 3     | important | To solve the problem of the change of denoising and sharpening effect and the dimming of brightness after AIQ startup in dark environment | The connection between kernel phase and aiq is not smooth in dark environment | none         |
| 4     | critical  | To solve the problem of full-parameter image effect, it needs to match the AIQ submission 0ed3f415d3, otherwise the image will turn green | the image effect is abnormal in full-parameter               | none         |
